# Task 4 – Firewall Configuration using UFW (Kali Linux)

## Objective
To configure and test basic firewall rules on Kali Linux using UFW.

## Tool Used
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- Kali Linux

## Steps Performed
1. Installed and enabled UFW on Kali Linux.
2. Checked default firewall status and rules.
3. Blocked inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet).
4. Tested the blocked port using Telnet.
5. Allowed SSH traffic on port 22.
6. Removed test rules and verified final firewall configuration.

## Security Insight
Telnet uses plaintext communication and is insecure. Blocking unused or insecure ports reduces attack surface.

## Outcome
This task provided hands-on experience with firewall configuration, traffic filtering, and basic Linux network security practices.

## Screenshots
Screenshots of each step are available in the `screenshots` folder.
